# Introduction
EEL (Early Experimental Language) is a small programming language. Although
its programming skills are small, this educational language has rich
components and the construction of its compiler has a lot of interest, since
there are many commands used in other languages, as well as some
are new. EEL supports functions and procedures, parameter transmission with reference
and value, recursive calls, and other interesting structures. It also allows nesting in
a statement of functions and procedures that is supported by few languages.
On the other hand, EEL does not support basic programming 
tools such as the structure for, or data types such as real numbers and strings. These omissions 
have been made to simplify the compiler's manufacturing process, a simplification
it has to do with the reduction of the code lines and not with the difficulty to code it.
